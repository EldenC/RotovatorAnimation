The intent is to model a rotovator that will reduce or eliminate the need for orbital refuelling and possibly reduce the need for Starship's heat shield.
The defaults are set to pick up Starship immediately after hot staging, approximately (4.6km/s at 65.3 km altitude).  
Which would deposit a returning Starship from the Moon, Mars, or Refueling orbit at a velocity low enough to not need a heat shield.
From what I understand Starship can withstand 6 G's or more fully loaded atleast when supported from the bottom.  
Can it withstand 8 G's supported from the catch mounts?  
The defualts are a little over that to allow for getting to Earths escape velocity. 

Mouse wheel zooms in and out.  
For finer control of the parameters you can highlight the slider and use the left and right arrows.
Interaction on a phone is a little sketchy.

2D Rotovator simulation

The intent is to model a rotovator that will reduce or eliminate the need for orbital refuelling and possibly reduce the need for Starship's heat sheild.
The defaults are set to pick up starship immediatly after hot staging, approximatly (4.6km/s at 65.3 km altitude).  
Which would deposit a returning Starship from the Moon, Mars, or Refueling orbit at a velocity low enough to not need a heat shield.
From what I understand Starship can withstand 6 G's or more fully loaded atleast when supported from the bottom.  
Can it withstand 6 G's supported from the catch mounts?
